EX1 base calculator and convertor:


This project provides utility functions for working with numbers in different bases (from base 2 to base 16). 
It includes functionalities to validate base-specific number strings, convert numbers between bases, check equality of numbers in various bases, and identify the maximum value in an array of such numbers. 
The code also supports multiplication and conversion to a target base.

## Key Functions
- `number2Int`: Converts a base-specific number string to its decimal representation.
- `int2Number`: Converts a decimal number to a string in the specified base.
- `isNumber`: Validates whether a string is a valid base-specific number.
